# Thesenanschlag: an Introduction for a Secular Reader [^1]

> Hie stehe ich, ich kann nicht anderst, sie Gott mir helffe. Amen

Religion is sublime and glorious thing, the bond of society of earth, and the connector of humanity with the Divine nature; but there is nothing so dangerous to man as the wresting of any of its principles, or forcing them beyond their due bounds; this is of all others the readiest way to destruction. Neither is there anything so easily done. There is not an error into which a man can fall, which he may not press Scripture into his service as proof of the probity of, and though you boasted theologian shunned before the discussion of the subject before me, while you pressed it, I can easily see that both you and he are carrying your ideas of absolute predestination, and its concomitant appendages, to an extent that other throws all religion and revelation together ; or, at least jumbles them in to a chaos, out of which human capacity can never select what is good.[^2]

> I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men and German to my horse.[^3]

What a perfect image for the birth of modernity. All Hallows’ Eve, 1517. A thirty three year old man, thin, high cheek boned, in the habit of the Eremetical Order of St Augustine, approaches the massive doors of the Schlosskirche in Wittenberg. In one hand a manuscript of 95 five paragraphs – the theses against indulgences. In the other a hammer and nails. And as he drives the nails into the oak door, each blow of the hammer against each nail sends out reverberations which shake the foundations of the medieval world and cause its institutions to crash to the ground. But the reason for that image being perfect for the birth of modernity is because it probably never happened at all. In the autumn of 1517 the young monk Martin Luther still thought of himself as the loyal servant of the Catholic Church, pointing out the theological errors of another German, the friar Johan Tetzel. The complex story of what is referred to in Germany as the Thesenanschlag has itself a long story: what did (or might have happened) back in 1517 is the still the stuff of academic debate.[^4]

Now more than 500 Years have passed since the traditional starting date of the Reformation does it matter to a secular and post Christian society? If nothing else, a possible half millennium has given all sides in the Luther debate time for pause and reflexion – even to the point of asking whether there are whether there are “sides” in the discussion anymore. But the relics of that debate remain all around us. The Cathedrals and older Churches of the British Isles are the concrete examples of both a break and a continuity with the past – many se were originally Roman Catholic edifices. To the outsider the nuances that separate different shades of Christian theology may seem pointless – if, of course, they give the subject any thought at all. And yet the old religious divisions of Europe periodically revisit the modern world – often in secular guise. Ideas of evangelism with their roots in the sixteenth century psyche inform the thinking of the increasing influential religious right in the USA. Roman Catholics are still official discriminated against in the Act of Union of 1707, although the threat of a Jacobite coup is probably remote. And the ethnic cleansing that characterised England’s relationship with Ireland from Elizabethan times to the Wolfe Tone rebellion and beyond still casts its long shadow. Even something as dull as land law can sometimes resurrect the ghosts of England’s Catholic past. Purgatory was central to Medieval theology: that half-way house between heaven and hell where the dead can redeem past sins and make their way to paradise. And through prayer the dead can be aided on their journey, so the cautious or the sinful were used to providing for a bit of post mortem aid through the establishment of Chantries where prayers from the living could be said in perpetuity for their souls.

But biblical evidence for purgatory was slight. Henry VII built one of the last Chantries as an adjunct to Westminster Abbey: it was his son’s odd mixture of Pope-less Catholicism that removed purgatory from the practice of Christianity in England, and with it the need to pray for the souls of the departed. So what to do with the money set aside for those prayers? Easy: convert the obligation of the living to pray for the dead to an obligation on the living to keep the church in good repair. Sounds daft: that’s probably what the defendants thought in the 2003 case of Parochial Church Council of the Parish of Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley, Warwickshire v Wallbank[^5]. Here the defendants bought a glebe farm in Warwickshire, not realising that the property came with an (unregistrable) obligation to repair the nearby church roof, an obligation that had converted from those prayers for the dead after the Henrician reforms. The House of Lords held in favour of the imposition of the obligation: it is unlikely that the Wallbanks were overly impressed by this remnant of the doctrine of purgatory.


Catholicism is certainly not unique in memorialising the past. The Mass is central to Catholic belief, as is the turn of the liturgical year: a sense of history should be second nature to Catholics, but reaching for historical narratives is not as natural as it perhaps should be. Many Catholics in the British Isles today have an ambivalent attitude to their own religious histories. From a British (or perhaps it would be better to say a Whig[ish][^6]) outlook, Catholics are inclined to think they are on the losing side of history. This is odd: looked at from a worldwide or even a European perspective this takes a Catholic tendency to martyrdom and marries it with an English aversion to triumphalism, but whatever the reason the attitude can get in the way of a true perspective on the events of the Reformation. Fortunately, modern scholarship is beginning to redress the balance: consider Eamon Duffy’s work, particularly the re-evaluation of the Marian reconversions.[^7]

So now perhaps we should be glad of being able to re-assess both Luther and our responses to the Reformation. Last time there was a centenary - 1917 – Europe had rather a lot of other concerns. Celebrating “the best type of German manhood”[^8] or even “grand rough old Martin Luther”[^9] would have been out of the question during the First World War, just as back in the nineteen sixties the centenary of the American Civil War passed without comment in a United States traumatised by Viet Nam and My Lai. What we celebrate – what we choose to remember tells us more about us now than it does about the past. 2017 was in one sense the first opportunity to reflect on the Reformation and Luther’s contribution to it without being caught up in partisan debates - whether from a theological or a national perspective.

Luther has, however, always been just a bit of a problem for protestant in Britain – as the coins in your pocket (if you still carry coins) will tell you: those initials “FD” are a final relic of (Roman) Catholic England. The tile of Fedelis Defensor was an honorific was granted to Henry VIII after much lobbying, for his work attacking Luther’s theology. Rather than require the monarch to give up a papal title, the Church of England obliged successive kings and queens by keeping to the notion that the Christian liturgy was based on there being seven sacraments: Luther had rationalised them down to three. Henry’s attack on Luther’s views, and his affirmation of traditional Catholic teaching, had led to the papal title, something that Henry would not abandon, even after he ditched the Pope. So despite the break with Rome, Henry stuck with his sacramental red lines. And when Thomas Cromwell tried to give England an off the shelf ready-made protestant theology, bringing England closer to Lutheran states by arranging Henry’s marriage to Anne of Cleaves[^10], it all ended in disaster: Cromwell lost his head and Henry stuck with an essentially (Roman) Catholic world view but minus the Pope, Purgatory, and without the central figure of medieval Christian practice - the Virgin Mary.

In the years from 1500 to 1650 the world changed perhaps as much as it did between the fall of Rome and the Rise of Charlemagne, or between 1914 and 1945.

It is perhaps a little facile, however, to accept the notion that the turmoil of the sixteenth century was yet again an example of the negative impact of religion on mankind, still less to write off the century as little more than the necessary birth pains of the Enlightenment. The world was certainly changing, All the component parts of the United Kingdom rely on foundation myths extracted from the Reformation and its aftermath, and any challenge to those foundation myths can be seen as a direct attack on modern rather than historical certainties. And curiously, there is a strand of modern Roman Catholic thought that needs its corrupt Popes and Bloody Marys[^11] as a way of shaping the Church today: the Catholic Church’s own “Counter Reformation” is perhaps a misnomer: the Counter Reformation wasn’t a return to a Catholicism before Luther, but to yet another new take on religious practices.

## The Roman Catholic Church in the Sixteenth Century - in rude health or a pagan version of Christianity?

It is an enduring myth, and in some ways a myth that endures most strongly amongst Catholics and Catholic thinkers, that the Roman Catholic Church was in terminal decline by 1500. Armed with this notion, the Reformation can be seen to be a generally good thing. However, the notion of an ailing and sick Church is simply wrong. As Mark Greengrass put it:[^12]

“There is no sign that the coming of the Reformation can be explained by the ‘abuses’ of the Church. All the evidence (construction, donations, pilgrimages, elaborate triptych altarpieces) is that it was flourishing. And the diversity of ritual and experience was held in an embrace of orthodoxy by a Church that claimed a monopoly of truth and salvation.”

It is dangerous to generalise. Isolated examples of corruption within, say, the monastic orders cannot evidence a systemic failing of the Church as an institution. Equally citing examples of what the Church was like in Italy, say, or Scotland won’t give an evidential basis for assumptions about Catholicism in Switzerland or England. Liturgically, too, pre-Reformation Catholicism would have displayed a high degree of diversity – witness the Sarum Rite.
 
Of course just because the Church actually supported and gave the majority of what Europe’s population craved for their spiritual lives didn’t mean the Catholicism was beyond censure, at least in the minds of the reformers. As we will see below, Catholic intellectuals did not consider the Church perfect, but their attacks were directed towards specific reforms. More recently both Catholic and Protestant historians have seen in the Reformation a demonstration of the power of a clerical elite supported by a growing, literate, and sceptical middle class – Catholic or Protestant – out evangelise a Europe that was in fact incompletely Christianised Europe. As Fr Andrew Greeley has explained:[^13]

“In one sense, the Reformation was a protest of a segment of the clerical elite and a newly emerging middle class against the continuation of paganism[^14] at a time when the Dark Ages had been definitely left behind. Historian Stephen Ozment, no foe to Protestantism, remarks of the Reformation and the Counter Reformation that they were a ‘conservative campaign on the part of elite Christian clergy to subdue a surrounding native culture that had always been and preferred to remain semi-pagan…an attempt to impose on uneducated and reluctant men and women a Christian way of life utterly foreign to their own experiences and very much against their own desires.’ Having undercut traditional Catholic ritual and practice, he adds, the Reformation unloosed far worse superstitions, especially concerning witchcraft, that were among the horrors of European preliterate culture.”

If the Roman Catholic Church wasn’t decaying why did the Reformation take hold? Irrespective of the religious dimension the world was changing in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, because of economic and intellectual forces. Some of those forces were harnessed by the both the Catholic and Lutheran confessions, but some took on a life of their own which was ultimately to go well beyond Luther’s reforms – or even those of Calvin and the Genevan reformers.

## Economics - Cause or effect? 

So, starting with economics in England in the sixteenth century a revolution was under way. What had happened in the south eastern counties of the Kingdom in the 1530s was recorded a generation later by the Reverend William Harrison, in his Description of Britain and England, first published as part of the Chronicles of England by Raphael Holinshed[^15]. As Andro Linklater has pointed out of the Reverend Harrison[^16]:


“He noted one thing in particular that the old men of the village thought to be ‘marvellously altered in England within their sound remembrance... the multitude of chimneys lately erected, whereas in their young days there were not above two or three if so many, but each made his fire against a reredos in the hall, where he dined and dressed [cooked] his meat…

Now cooking was done on a spit over the fireplace and in brick ovens next to the fire on one side of the hall, while food was eaten at table on the other side. But the hall was no longer one space. The storage area was walled off into a separate room. The final, vital part of the transformation was the huge black beam…installed in the ceiling of what is now the living room of this farmhouse. The sixty-foot length of oak was put in to support the floor boards of the upper rooms where the new-fangled bedchamber was to be situated so that [the farmer] and his wife could sleep alone. By the time he had finished, the common space inside his home, like the homes of all those sixteenth century yeoman farmers, was divided into individual, enclosed rooms for eating, sleeping and other, more private, activities”

Why are sixteenth century home improvements relevant? Because they are a reflection of an extraordinary increase in wealth in the south of England. Not just improved houses either: inside there would have been pewter plates, not wooden platters, and feather beds rather than straw mattresses. Where did the wealth come from? From the 1450s wool prices rose across Europe. The population of Europe was growing after the ravages of the Black Death in the previous century, and the growing population had to be clothed – in wool. The south east of England was just a boat trip across the Channel to Antwerp, and from Antwerp via the Elbe and the Rhine cloth could be exported to all of Europe.

By 1500 even tenant farmers were making more money than they - or their parents- had ever done before. As well as the booming demand for English wool farmers were realising how they could profit from technological changes. In changing from strip farming to enclosures land holdings were consolidated. Sheep kept together manured the land, increasing its fertility and lessening the need for letting it lie fallow. One acre thus enclosed could produce far more than many scattered acres. But enclosure meant that a large labour force was unnecessary: massive profits were there for the taking – if you got rid of the labour force. In Warwickshire 61 villages were wiped before 1500 as a result of enclosures. What happened to the Highlands during the clearances of the 19th Century was happening in the south east of England in the sixteenth century.

Andro Linklater again[^17]:-

> Yet that was the very point of the revolution: to allow one person to profit from the land, regardless of the consequences to the community. The whole basis of land ownership up to that moment [i.e. the 16th Century] – mutual obligation, recognition of custom and tradition, and encompassing sense of justice that tied all to the same set of values – became irrelevant.

The problems presented by enclosure had been recognised at least as early as 1489 by Henry VIII’s own father, who had Parliament pass “An Act Against the Pulling Down of Touns” but it did little good. Thomas More saw the problem and satirised in in Utopia;

But I do not think that this necessity of stealing arises only from hence; there is another cause of it, more peculiar to England." "What is that?" said the Cardinal. "The increase of pasture," said I, "by which your sheep, which are naturally mild, and easily kept in order, may be said now to devour men and unpeople, not only villages, but towns; for wherever it is found that the sheep of any soil yield a softer and richer wool than ordinary, there the nobility and gentry, and even those holy men, the abbots not contented with the old rents which their farms yielded, nor thinking it enough that they, living at their ease, do no good to the public, resolve to do it hurt instead of good. They stop the course of agriculture, destroying houses and towns – reserving only the churches – and enclose grounds that they may lodge their sheep in them.”

As the century progressed Parliament was dominated by exactly those who benefitted most from enclosures and were thus reluctant to legislate against their own interests. Henry VIII had many faults, but he was not one to pass up a revenue source. However, his attempts to tax profits from land failed in the teeth of opposition from both the Courts and Parliament. Henry, though his councillor Thomas Cromwell, found an alternative revenue streams: expropriating the wealth of the Church. But to be able to access this source of wealth Henry needed political allies in Parliament and a justification to attack both Rome and the monasteries. And Henry had his own personal reasons for the break: his frustration with the refusal of Paul III’s predecessor, Clement VII, to grant his annulment….

Max Weber saw the new mercantile spirit as the consequence of new Protestant ethic.[^18] However, this notion is contrary to the evidence of an increasing commercialism arising before the Reformation. In reality it was new forms of religious thought arising as the 16th Century progressed that offered an already existing rising mercantile class an attractive justification for wealth and power – not the other way around.

## Politics: How Protestantism survived in a time of dynastic Instability and military adventurism.

It is curious how some rulers, however virtuous or villainous, disappear from the public conscious long before their remains have turned to dust. Others live on, often unjustly praised or pilloried, not because of what they did in their lifetimes, but because they become useful cyphers for our own times. Henry VIII has lived on in our imaginations, but rarely do his contemporaries feature in the public mind. But the other European rulers during the Reformation, such as Charles V, Francis I, John Frederick the Magnanimous, Popes like Clement VII and Paul III and the Ottoman Emperor, Suleiman the Magnificent, all had their role in forming the Reformation and its consequences which transcend their individual beliefs: politics was often a driver behind belief as often as belief changed politics. Take Suleiman: a devout Muslim, but periodic ally of the (Catholic) Francis I against the (Catholic) Charles V. Indeed, according to the contemporary account from the Bishop of Montpelier, the Reformation would have gone the same way as the Albigensians but for Suleiman.

 

Reformation politics though can be seen to revolve around Charles V. He was elected Emperor in 1519[^19], on the death of Maximillian I, his grandfather, having inherited the newly united Kingdom of Spain some two years earlier when the heir to the throne, Juan, pre-deceased him.


The reputation of the Holy Roman Empire has suffered over the years, often dismissed with Voltaire’s aphorism that it was neither holy, roman, nor an empire.[^20] However, viewing the Holy Roman Empire with the benefit of an Anglo centric hindsight is unhelpful. The Empire withstood the Reformation and, later, the catastrophe of the Thirty Years’ War without collapse. The Empire that Charles ruled was enormous and powerful, stretching from the Hungarian plain to South America, and from Italy to Low Countries. There was, perhaps, an element of luck in Charles’ position, but also astute politics: Fortes bella gerunt, tu felix Austria nube.[^21]


In 1477 the Swiss had changed the face of European history when they hacked to death the last Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, at the battle of Nancy. Charles had an heir – the 19-year-old Mary of Burgundy. The King of France at that time, Louis XI, could have seized a dynastic opportunity to bring Burgundy back in to the French fold, healing the division that had nearly lost France the 100 Years’ War. Lacking subtlety he invaded: Mary looked for protection and found it in a marriage to Maximillian I. Mary gave Maximillian one son, Philip the Handsome, before dying in a riding accident after only five years of marriage. This left Maximillian free to marry again, which he did: to Bianca Maria Sforza, the daughter of the Duke of Milan. Meanwhile, Philip the Handsome was married off to Juana, the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, the monarchs who united Spain and expelled the Moors.

 

Unfortunately for the Spanish line, Ferdinand and Isabella son Juan died without an heir: the other daughter was Catherine of Aragon. Being Charles V’s aunt was to have consequences for English politics. Philip died of typhoid: Juana couldn’t accept his death and for years travelled with his coffin (and became known as Juana the Mad). She did, however, give him 6 children: 4 girls and two boys, Charles and Ferdinand. With no other heirs to the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, Charles’ inheritance was enormous – the Habsburg lands, Burgundy, and Spain – and through Spain large chunks of the New World. It would grow still further, in a development that would have a profound influence on the future destiny of the Habsburgs, in the marriage of Mary of Habsburg to Louis II Jagiellon, King of Hungary: Louis was killed fighting Suleiman at the battle of Mohacs in 1526, leaving Hungary to be divided between Charles and Suleiman.

So who was Charles V? Despite his importance in some ways he remains enigmatic: perhaps more so now than he would have done to his contemporaries. Take nationality, for example. Today, people frequently use nationality as part of their self-portrait. But what was Charles’ nationality? He was born in Bruges (probably) of Austro – Iberian parents: even here terminology is tricky, because it would be anachronistic to speak of “Spain” as the time of his birth: Castile and Aragon shared monarchs but were separate kingdoms. He was brought up speaking Flemish for the first 17 years of his life, until he moved to Spain, effectively deposing his mother Juana the Mad and became the first King of Spain. He impressed the locals with his ability to pick up both Castilian and bull fighting. He would have had no doubts about his Catholicism, but those deeply held beliefs did not stop him attacking the Papacy when it was politically expedient to do so, or supporting his Jewish Shtadlan, Josel ben Gershon of Rosheim against the anti-Semitic polemic of the convert, Antonius Margarita, at the Diet of Augsburg.

Just what Charles thought of as his “nationality” in the modern sense of that word is unclear, but perhaps only his potential rivals Francis I and Henry VIII would have felt about that subject in a way that would be familiar to us today. We may gauge something of Charles’ multiple linguistic abilities from the famous quote at the start of this paper.

It is also important to realise that the Holy Roman Empire was effective for reasons quite opposite to those that made France and the combined states of England, Wales and Ireland akin to modern nation states. It was effective in foreign policy and in economics because it was a loose agglomeration of states, with a recognition within those states that some were more equal than others. How far this was the product of being an elective monarchy, rather than an hereditary one is hard to say. It may explain in part Charles’ reluctance to use military means to crush the Lutheran states until he had exhausted all other avenues – and why the Catholic Elector of Saxony chose to protect Luther as a means of asserting Saxon political independence.

In addition to Charles reluctance to take steps that could damage the Empire, in the years that followed Luther’s 95 theses and his defiance at the Diet of Worms, he had other preoccupations. Back in 1515 Francis I broke the reputation of Swiss invincibility at the battle of Marignano, reviving Francis’ preoccupation in restoring France’s Italian domains that had once belonged to his Angouleme ancestors. But Charles didn’t want the French in the Italian peninsula – he was, after all, the King of the Romans. The Popes from Julius II onwards had their own political agenda, perhaps wary of allowing secular powers to dominate the Papacy as had happened during the Avignon schism.

To avoid French domination Leo X signed a secret treaty with Charles in 1521, but after a rather over indulgent banquet Leo died that same year. Charles had sufficient influence to have his preferred candidate – his Dutch tutor, Adrian Florenz Dedal - elected Pope as Adrian VI, but it was not a popular appointment in Rome. Adrian was not Italian, nor did he have the taste for opulence of a Borgia or a Medici. He was not impressed with the extravagant beauty of Rome, dismissing the extensive entourage that had ministered to Leo’s needs and instead maintaining a household of exactly one – his Flemish house keeper. He wanted to white-wash the Sistine Chapel[^22] and have the statue of Laocoon thrown in the Tiber. However, before he could impose his regime of austerity he died, to be succeeded by another Medici, Giulio, who took the title Clement VII. More politicking between Francis I and Clement VII would have dramatic implications for the Papacy, France, and the Empire. Francis I attempt to build a French enclave in the Emperor’s Italian back yard would lead to the ignominy of Francis’s defeat at Pavia, and his imprisonment.

Worse would follow. Clements’s attempts to secure the temporal power of the Papacy by intervening on the side of the French would lead to the sack of Rome – and 14,000 dead at the hands of German Lutheran troops, generalled by a French Catholic, on behalf of a Catholic Emperor. Clement was taken prisoner: a predicament that Henry VIII tried unsuccessfully to turn to his advantage by offering to bail out the Pope in return for an annulment.

While Charles V’s problems with the French were far from over, despite ultimately the first peace treaty in European history negotiated by women – the Treaty of Cambrai, the work of Margaret of Austria and Louise of Savoy – in many ways he had a more formidable foe to the east. Suleiman the Magnificent had taken Belgrade in 1521 and Rhodes in 1522, destroyed the Hungarians at Mohacs and was to menace Vienna in 1529. He was also the Catholic Francis I’s trump card: secret and not so secret treaties between Francis and Suleiman preoccupied Charles, preventing decisive military action against the reformers throughout the 1520 – 30s.

## The New (and the not so new) Learning

One traditional view saw the fall of Constantinople to Mehmet II as the start of the Renaissance. Greek scholars left Constantinople and brought the leaning with them to Italy. In reality, new learning had been bursting on to the scene long before the fall of the eastern Roman Empire. Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio all predate 1453. Equally, the sack of Rome in 1527 was seen as the endpoint of the Italian Renaissance. Whatever start or end date is chosen it cannot be denied that by 1500 the nature of secular learning and philosophy was changing, and those changes in turn influenced theologians.

The Medieval world had rejoiced in a synthesis of Aristotelian logic and Christian faith, exemplified in the works of Aquinas, the exemplar of learning in a period often labelled the 12th Century “renascence” to distinguish it from the Quattrocento.

What was different in the Renaissance compared to the renascence was the emphasis on going back to original sources. The skills to do so developed and were exemplified in the works of Poggio and his rival Valla – and it was Valla who exposed the Donation of Constantine. The latter had been used as to show that Constantine I had gifted the Western Roman Empire to the Church in recognition for having been cured of leprosy by Pope Sylvester. Valla showed that the Latin of the Donation did not belong to the fourth but top the eighth century. Valla identified words like “satrap” which did not belong to Constantine’s Latin. Although writing in the 1440s, Valla’s work was not published until 1516, and was not surprisingly a text used by both Luther and Thomas Cromwell for anti-Papal purposes.

The problem with relying on facts – or what are thought to be facts - as opposed to reason, logic or faith, is that exposures like Valla’s can have undermine belief. It is of no consequence spiritually the Pope had no grant of temporal power from a long dead emperor, but in the turbulent times of the 16th Century – when Valla’s work on the Donation begin circulating wildly – the assertion of temporal power based on a proven falsity continued a process of questioning papal power, dented by the Western Schism.

Valla was a priest and well respected by at least some of the papal hierarchy – Nicholas V had made him a papal nuncio. In being a critic from inside the Church Valla was by no means alone. Perhaps the Church’s most famous detractor was Erasmus. His attack on the excesses of the Papacy in his work “In Praise of Folly” was ironic but stinging: -

“What disasters would befall if ever the Supreme Pontiffs, the Vicars of Christ, should make the attempt to imitate His life of poverty and toil? …Thousands of scribes, sycophants…muleteers …and pimps would become unemployed.”

But Erasmus, like Thomas More, was writing in Latin not in a vernacular. Erasmus developed and adopted Valla’s literary skills, going back to original sources and preparing a Greek edition of the New Testament – but in doing so, although he identified over a thousand errors in St Jerome’s Vulgate, he cautiously had the Pope write an introductory preface.

His intention was plain:

> I wish that every woman might read the Gospel and the Epistles of St Paul. Would that these were translated into every language… and understood not only Scots and Irishman but by Turks and Saracens. Would that the farmer might sing snatches of Scripture as his plough, then the weaver might hum passages of Scripture to the tune of his shuttle…

Whatever the actual intentions of the type of criticism coming from Erasmus and More the growth of the critical method employed and the openness to learning have often been cited - by those who would praise or denigrate the changing relationship between man and God in the sixteenth century -or indeed in our own time. Étienne Gilson (1884-1978), the noted philosopher and historian of ideas, saw humanism removing God from the Medieval world view: -

> The difference between the Renaissance and the Middle Ages was not a difference by addition but by subtraction. The Renaissance was not the Middle Ages plus man but the Middle ages minus God…

Critiquing the Renaissance is an activity not confined to Catholics. The hugely influential theologian and thinker, Reinhold Niebuhr, saw dangers in the promotion of the “very unchristian Christian concept of the autonomous individual” the Russian exile and Orthodox philosopher Nicholas Berdyaev went further and saw the man-centric views of the post renaissance world as the ultimate challenge and tragedy of modern history: “Renaissance Humanism affirmed the autonomy of man, and his freedom in the sphere of cultural creation, science, and art. Herein lay its truth, for it was essential that the creative force of humanity should surmount the obstacles and prohibitions that the medieval Christianity put in its way. Unfortunately, the Renaissance also began to assert man’s self-sufficiency, and to make a rift between him and eternal truths of Christianity…. Here we have the fountain head of the tragedy of modern history…. God became the enemy of man, and man the enemy of God.”

Luther’s most famous words are a slogan for the autonomy of the individual driven by his conscious and the aligning of his conscious with scripture: Hie stehe ich, ich kann nicht anderst, Got helffe mir. Amen. Whether those words were uttered at Wörms or not, and whether Luther himself intended to promote individualism over communitarian values, the religious world took to their humanist garb. – to the point where societies in Europe and America now deem it necessary to protect their citizens from discrimination for manifesting religious beliefs.

## Luther and the law – and how events changed Luther.

But for a thunder storm and the intersession of St Anne Luther might have followed his father‘s wish and entered the legal profession, not the Augustinians. Whilst Luther was sensible enough to realise that legal counsel could be helpful to him at the Diet of Wörms (in fact he brought along a Professor of Law from Wittenberg, Hieronymus Schurff) his attitude to lawyers and law, canon or civil varied from between grudging acceptance of their utility and downright condemnation and vituperation. To Luther, at least in his early days, his attack on canon law and Papal authority quickly spilled into an attack on any laws and restrictions: the Bible, after all, contained all the guidance needed for individual or corporate living. When rulers and jurist objected to radical Biblicism as a potential recipe for tyranny and blasphemy Luther was incensed – and true to form he went on the attack. “Jurists are bad Christians … Every jurist is an enemy of Christ…I shit on the law of the pope and of the emperor, and on the law of the jurists as well “[^23]


Early in Luther’s career as a reformer and before Wörms, he had published De Liberate Christiana – “Freedom of the Christian”. “Freedom” is a slippery concept like “conscience” and Luther‘s call for “freedoms” here was to result in an attack on the Church that anticipated the dissolution of the Monasteries in England. John Witte has put it:[^24]


“Few church structures survived [the] heady days of the 1520s. The church’s canon law books were burned. Church courts were closed. Monastic institutions were confiscated. Endowed benefices were dissolved. Church lands were seized. Clerical privileges were stripped. Mendicant begging was banned. Mandatory celibacy was suspended. Indulgence trafficking was condoned. Annates were outlawed. Ties to the pope were severed. The German people were to live by the pure light of the Bible and the simple law of the community.”


Luther’s notion that all persons stand directly before God had a universal appeal: but to treat it as a practical instruction instead of a theological theory was to court disaster, and that disaster followed quickly.


As the bonds of civil society were undermined with nothing to replace them, civil unrest spread. Whilst economics played a very significant part in peasant unrest, just as it had done in the peasant rebellions in England and France in the fourteenth century, the undermining of authority produced inevitable results.

Luther in his early writings had a tendency to conflate the law of the Old Testament with earthly law – which he referred to as the law of the magistrate – and to criticise both as the work of the devil. The more he attacked all forms of earthly law - not just the Mosaic law but canon law and Roman law too- the closer he got to becoming seen as an advocate of antinomianism. This was not his intention, but it gave some of his early followers the material they needed for ideas which would be radical today, never mind in the sixteenth century. Coupled with worsening economic conditions it was not long before civil unrest erupted into the Peasant’s War – and Luther made it clear he was on the side of authority, not revolt. Practical politics was soon shaping Luther’s views as much as theology. In so doing Luther addressed paradoxical views of human nature: that each Christian was a lord subject to no man, and a priest the servant of all. John Witte again: -

It is the duty of Christians of all sorts “to work the work of God in the world,” Luther argued. As citizens of the earthly kingdom, Christians were not to withdraw ascetically from the “things of the world, “abstaining from its activities and institutions as certain Anabaptists of the day taught. Rather, Christians were to participate actively in those earthly institutions and activities, to confirm their natural origin and function, and to use human will and reason, however defective, to do as much good and to attain as much understanding as possible. “God himself ordained and established this earthly realm and its distinctions, “Luther wrote. “We must reason and work in them so long as we are on earth.”[^25]

The above passage without the references to Luther, might be mistaken for a Catholic defence of the need for good works. Had events taken a different course the differences between Luther’s views and Catholic orthodoxy might have blurred even in the sixteenth century – one Pope – Hadrian VI – and one prospective Pope – Reginald Pole - had displayed thinking very much closer to Luther’s view than might have been assumed possible. However, Luther was still Luther even then. If Luther’s experience of the anarchy of the Peasant’s War changed his view of the need for earthly laws his antipathy to the Pope remained as strong as ever. This coloured his ideas of the nature the division between spiritual and temporal use of power. Luther developed the concept of the Zwei Reichelehre – the two kingdoms theory.

Within this concept - as with many of Luther’s ideas - there is an element of superficial common-sense that on further examination turns out to be anything but sensible. Keeping Church and state separate could be seen as a modern necessity – as viewed by the French state’s concept of laïcité. However, it also brings within it the danger of complicity or indifferences to the state’s excess. One of Britain’s greatest historian pondered this as she surveyed the ruins of post war Berlin, on the 400th anniversary of Luther’s death: -

“Few would deny that Luther’s political influence, on Europe and Germany, was unfortunate. His innate conservatism, his deliberate subjection of the Church to the State and the doctrine of submission to the temporal powers which was implicit in this, laid an effective foundation for the bureaucratic-autocratic state”[^26]

Luther’s flexible approach to earthly laws had, in its day, a notorious example in his support for the bigamous marriage of Philip of Hesse, originally given in secret by Luther (and Melanchthon) in December of 1539[^27]. But a darker shadow yet was to be cast over Luther’s reputation than his approval of a bigamous marriage.

## Luther, an anti-Semite?

Was Luther an anti-Semite? Certainly, there was much in his writings that would be seized by anti-Semite in the future, and there were those too that during the Nazi era sort to align the Church with the Nazi party – even to the extent of Lutheran Pastors comparing him to Adolf Hitler.[^28] As Heiko Oberman explains:[^29]

> Any attempt to deal with the Reformer runs up against this obstacle. No description of Luther’s campaign against the Jews, however objective and erudite it may be, escapes the horror: we live in the post -Holocaust era. Under the spell of nightmarish terror, it is difficult to peer thought the shadows of history, making clear judgments, passing a just sentence, as we grope our way along the path between aggressive accusation and apologetic explanation.

Following expulsions from France and England, Jews had lived and prospered in Medieval Germany for many years. It would be wrong to suggest that existence was at best much more than grudging toleration, punctuated by capricious pogroms. However, that toleration had allowed Jews like Josel Ben Gershon to thrive, and had seen synagogues built in many imperial towns. Interest in accurate biblical translation had perhaps helped bridge gaps between the communities: Johannes Reuchlin studied Hebrew and was the First non-Jew to write a Hebrew grammar. Reuchlin considered that Jews in the Empire should be seen as co-citizens – “concives”. It was to Josel ben Gershon that Wolfgang Capito – a Christian who admired Jewish erudition although not their religion - turned after Luther’s patron, John Frederick the Wise, chose to expel Jews from Saxony in 1536.

Both Josel and Capito had expected Luther to be sympathetic and to intercede with John Frederick. Luther was not. Luther had hoped that his reformed ideologies had removed from Christianity idolatrous aspects of the religion that were a barrier to the conversion of the Jews, but the Jewish communities had sided with the Emperor. As Luther aged he saw a triumvirate of enemies ready to gang up on him – the Pope, the Jews and the Turks.

It should not be assumed, however, that Luther’s views were shared by all reformers. His lifelong friend and companion Justus Jonas and Andreas Osiander both hoped for a common liberation of the spirit for Jews and Christians in the Last Days. Thomas Müntzer was even more radical – and preached a doctrine that had no quarrel with other faiths– “even the Turk”. There is evidence too of changing attitudes in the Wittenberg Hymnal, in verses which Luther himself may have written, which switch the blame for the Crucifixion from Judas to mankind.

However, the problem that was to lead to institutional anti-Semitism and its worst excesses under the Nazis was in part inherent in the triumphalism of those thinkers who saw in Luther’s reforms and the reforms of other Protestant confessions the perfection on earth not just of ideas, but institutions. With absolute belief in justification on earth for some there came an absolute belief that dissenters were not just wrong but already damned – whether they were Jews or alleged witches. As Oberman has explained[^30], in an imperfect Christian Church there was a “solidarity in sin” between “us wretched Christians” - a term used by Luther when lecturing on the psalms – and the Jews, but once the Reformation had rendered (or thought it had rendered) the Church perfect that solidarity went: -

> Such Protestant triumphalism permits heretics, papists, Jews, and ‘us wretched Christians’ to be looked back upon as past history…. Once this fundamental theological structure has developed the anti -Judaism found in Luther - or in the Christian faith as a whole – becomes a pawn of modern anti-Semitism

And whilst anti-Semitism was to thrive and mutate over the years leading inexorably to the holocaust, it was the same triumphalism - aided and abetted by the notion of religion as a private function - that was to see the rise of witchcraft trials and executions in Protestant Europe.

The end for Luther of his earthly life was to come in 1546. Eisleben in the small hours of the morning of February of that year would have been cold – and dark. No street lights, and not even a candle to pierce the blackness. Except perhaps at the inn where Martin Luther lay dying, having come to Eisleben some days before to arbitrate dispute between the two Counts of Manfeld, Albert and Gebherd. Death was not at this time a sanitised or private affair. Scientific thought at that time was that you could tell whether a dying person was saved or damned by how their last hours were passed. A sudden seizure or a heart attack was a sign that the devil had claimed a victim, dragging a soul out of the body and down to hell before the dying had made their peace. So, as much turned on Luther’s death, as on his life, and how it would be recorded.

Luther had come to Eisleben not for theological reasons but to settle a legal dispute, mirroring the career his father, Hans, had wanted for his son. Luther rejected a legal career and had turned to the Augustinian order after surviving a lightning strike. Ironically his son would follow the career his own father had wanted for him. And now Luther lay dying. Justus Jonas, who had been the Best Man at Luther’s wedding to Katherina Von Bora – was with him as he died. Justus knew exactly what the occasion needed. He immediately began to write a description of Luther’s last day on earth. He sent for a painter, Lucas Fortnagel, to capture Luther’s still body. Justus’ writings were not to send to Katharina to comfort her in her loss. They had a political purpose. His words were for Elector of Saxony, John Frederick the Magnanimous, and for the authorities at Wittenberg University.

The news of Luther’s death arrived just as another of Luther’s old companions, Philip Melanchthon, was lecturing the students on St Paul’s Letter to the Romans. Melanchthon stopped, stunned, and then changed from St Paul to the psalms: the Charioteer of Israel has fallen.

At the time of Luther’s death his old adversary Henry VIII had less than a year of his reign left. His rival in France. Francis I, would be dead too before another year was out. In Rome Pope Paul III had been in office for twelve years – and two years previously had called for a general council of the Church at Trent. The Holy Roman Empire had been ruled by Charles V since his election in 1519, although he had not been crowned until 1530. And in the Sublime Porte Suleiman the Magnificent, conqueror of Rhodes and Hungary, but also sometime ally of Francis I, had been Sultan as long as Charles V had been emperor.

## Conclusions: historical curiosities or a work in progress?

For those that like Bach an understanding of his works can be increased by listening to performances of, say, the Goldberg Variations by both Gustav Leonhardt and then Glen Gould. The experiences will be different but both will be enhancing musically and emotionally. Neither performance could be criticised as being “wrong” and neither performance invalidates the other: both are different and from those differences the listener can gain a range of insights that would not be available if there was such a thing as one “right” performance. Perhaps in the 1970s some enthusiasts for historically informed performance might have taken to smashing their Glen Gould records, or their Furtwängler Brandenburg Concertos[^31], seeing such actions as a necessary precursor of the general acceptance of historically informed performance practices. Musical criticism and appreciation has moved on since the 1970, without there being an acceptance of only one “correct” Goldberg, or perhaps worse, the acceptance that the only correct performance is a Gustav Gould mash –up.

Luther originally had thought he could ditch scholastic learning, and that sola scriptura would be enough: he would have smashed the records of the unauthentic performer[^32]. In reality both Protestant and Catholic confessions quickly realised the limits – and the dangers – of self-contained scriptural expositions. In the Catholic tradition there was never a rejection of Thomist thought: with the Council of Trent that tradition was once again at the forefront of Church thinking. Whilst Luther acknowledged his debt to St Augustine any hint of latent antinominism disappeared in the face of popular protests wracking the Empire in the 1520s. And just as Luther sought the safety of temporal powers so too did reformers revert to scholastic writers. The Church before the Reformation had been no stranger to what it saw as academic controversy: witnessed by, in particular, the intellectual dispute between the followers of Aquinas, the Thomists, and those who followed Duns Scotus, the Scotists. A secular philosopher might find the differences between a Thomist and a Scotist greater than the difference generated by distinction between salvation through faith and salvation through works: the former difference produced foot notes, the latter, wars.

Luther only saw one acceptable future for religion: his reforms. His view of the future had no room for a St Ignatius or a St Teresa, no room for a Pope of any sort, no room for an atheist or an anarchist, and (perhaps the only thing he might have found in common with Pope Paul IV) only temporary, grudging, unwelcome room for a recalcitrant Jew or Turk.

“Umbruch” is a German term often used by historians of the Renaissance and Reformation, denoting how there was a break with the past during those periods. Looking at the year 1500, and comparing Christendom then with Europe in 1650, would suggest to most that there had indeed been an irreversible break: and at the start of this paper the suggestion was made that that period of change was as radical as that separating the classical world from the Middle Ages. However, worlds can change without the past being dissolved. The world changed – but not necessarily by having the “umbruch” that some historians see. Certainly, the role of religion is more complex than simply seeing it as the principle driver of that “umbruch.” Politically, when expedient, Protestants formed allegiances with Catholics and Muslims: in a similar way, intellectually, both then and now, strands of religious thought that come from different denominations find support across the confessions. A Protestant Neo-Platonists may agree with a Catholics like (Cardinal) Henry de Lubac, and the Radical Orthodoxy movement within Anglicanism sides with Thomists against the Scotists. Even an atheist philosopher like Ayn Rand idolised Aquinas.

Does this matter, in a post Christian world? Both the Catholic and Lutheran Churches have made moves that would have been unthinkable even 50 years ago – as confirmed by documents such as the work “From Conflict to Communion.”[^33] That document is worth reading at a variety of levels, and, indeed, would suggest that the differences between the two confessions are so small as to be bridgeable in future by one final, short step.

Whether they will be, or whether they should be and how, topics for another day. The secular world inherited the Reformation ability to scrutinise and deconstruct texts, and it is easy to trace the Luther’s inheritors through both the Catholic world of Descartes and the Protestant world of Kant and Kierkegaard to the secular world of Feuerbach and Heidegger, but for now perhaps it is apt to end with the sentiments expressed in the Roman Catholic’s response to the 500th anniversary of the Thesenanschlag in “From Conflict to Communion”: -

“What happened in the past cannot be changed, but what is remembered of the past and how it is remembered can, with the passage of time, indeed change. Remembrance makes the past present. While the past itself is unalterable, the presence of the past in the present is alterable. In view of 2017, the point is not to tell a different history but to tell that history differently”

## A partial, subjective chronological Eurocentric overview: Key events from 1453 to 1560 in politics, religion, and the arts.

History, someone once said, is one damn thing after another. In order to make sense of the movement of events an old-fashioned list of dates can sometimes be helpful. The events portrayed in this paper roughly cover a period of one hundred years or so: it is sometimes useful to know who was Pope and who was the King of England, for example when Holbein was painting or Josquin was composing. The symbols *and †are used to denote a birth or a death.

The Grand Dukes of Lithuanian were both resolutely pagan and occasional allies of the Papacy against the growing powers of the Teutonic Knights. The last Grand Duke of the pagan persuasion, Jogaila, was not baptised until 15th February 1386, whereupon with Papal blessing he took both the name Władysław and a twelve-year-old wife, Jadwiga. The Teutonic Knights’ power was broken by Władysław at the battle of Grunwald: later, under their last Grand Master, a Hohenzollern, the Order converted en masse to Lutheranism.
